Usage: brew fetch [options] formula|cask [...]

Download a bottle (if available) or source packages for formulae and binaries
for casks. For files, also print SHA-256 checksums.

      --os                         Download for the given operating system.
                                   (Pass all to download for all operating
                                   systems.)
      --arch                       Download for the given CPU architecture.
                                   (Pass all to download for all
                                   architectures.)
      --bottle-tag                 Download a bottle for given tag.
      --HEAD                       Fetch HEAD version instead of stable version.
  -f, --force                      Remove a previously cached version and
                                   re-fetch.
  -v, --verbose                    Do a verbose VCS checkout, if the URL
                                   represents a VCS. This is useful for seeing
                                   if an existing VCS cache has been updated.
      --retry                      Retry if downloading fails or re-download if
                                   the checksum of a previously cached version
                                   no longer matches. Tries at most 5 times with
                                   exponential backoff.
      --deps                       Also download dependencies for any listed
                                   formula.
  -s, --build-from-source          Download source packages rather than a
                                   bottle.
      --build-bottle               Download source packages (for eventual
                                   bottling) rather than a bottle.
      --force-bottle               Download a bottle if it exists for the
                                   current or newest version of macOS, even if
                                   it would not be used during installation.
                                   $HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS_QUARANTINE is set.
                                   (deprecated)
      --formula, --formulae        Treat all named arguments as formulae.
      --cask, --casks              Treat all named arguments as casks.

Error: Invalid usage: Options --force-bottle and --bottle-tag are mutually exclusive.
